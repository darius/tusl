This is an experiment in adding interactive scripting to C programs
with as little fuss as possible.  The language is loosely derived from
Forth, but without trying to match any language standard.

About the name: Luke Gorrie once complained about my modest names for
programs (like Vapour and Miasma), and this is my reply.


QUICK START

$ cd <the-parent-directory-of-this-file>
$ make
$ tusl/runtusl '"tusl/babble.ts" load'

In this paper we will demonstrate that with structured 
deployment of transient policy criteria balanced by synchronized 
monitored utilities it is necessary for all optimal undocumented 
interaction to avoid optional monitored congruence.
